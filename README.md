# React useContext Demonstration Project

Welcome to the demonstration project for Sigma School's React lesson, focusing specifically on the use of React's `useContext` hook. This project is an educational tool designed to show how `useContext` can be utilized to manage and access state across different components in React applications without prop drilling.

## About This Project

This project serves as a practical example to help students understand and implement React's `useContext` in a real-world scenario. By exploring this project, students will learn how `useContext` simplifies state management and promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Live Demo
